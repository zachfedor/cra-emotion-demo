# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

You only need to have `yarn` installed, although `npm` works in a pinch if you know the correlated commands.\
Clone the repository, then open a terminal and `cd` to that directory where you'll be able to run the following scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Installs all the project dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn format`

Runs Prettier to see if all files conform to the configured style guidelines, or run `yarn format:fix` to fix them automatically.

### `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint to check code for potential bugs, typos, logic errors, or common pitfalls to be avoided.\
You can run `yarn lint:fix` to fix some issues automatically.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Learn More

The best place to learn React is the [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

The CSS-in-JS library we're using is called [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction). Older code uses the "CSS Prop" style but this demo mostly shows off Styled Components. The Getting Started docs should be enough to give you an idea of what is possible.

You can learn more about the setup and tooling in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
